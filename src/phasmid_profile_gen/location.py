"""The location group from a proxy exit IP: zone, position, WebRTC address, languages.

The exit IP is looked up in DB-IP City Lite (geoip.py). A row without a city
is refused: the country centroid it carries is a well-known tell. The row's
city coordinate gives the zone (pinned ``timezonefinder`` and its ODbL
boundary data), named by its IANA primary name. The served position is drawn
from the seed inside the accuracy circle around the city and must lie in the
same zone; a draw that does not is retried with the next draw a bounded number
of times. Languages are Chrome's default accept-languages for the UI locale of
a language of the country (CLDR's territoryInfo, drawn from the seed);
``languages=`` overrides them.

Accuracy is IP class only. The one measured stock answer is Google's IP-only
fix on Linux Chrome 156 over ethernet, 75609.25 m; Wi-Fi-class answers (tens of
metres) are unmeasured and never emitted.

Needs the ``location`` extra (timezonefinder, maxminddb).
